                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I am a current sophomore at Boise State University studying the GIMM (Gaming Interactive Mobile
                    Media)
                    program.
                    I'm looking to become a game developer to bring my ideas and designs into the world.
                    The purpose of this website is to display the skills and projects that I've developed in the last
                    two years
                    of college.</p>

                <h2>Scouts Adventure</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Scouts Adventure is my first 2D platformer and video game. This project was my introduction to C#,
                    Unity, Photoshop, and graphic design. It gave me a delightful opportunity to be introduced to game
                    development.
                    The most enjoyable part of the project was brainstorming and organizing the game concept.</p>

                <h2>Quantum Entangled</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Quantum Entangled is a group project that tells the love story of shapes to simplify the complex
                    concept
                    of
                    quantum entanglement.
                    I was the main developer of the art and concept, not so much of the code.
                    The most enjoyable part of the project was working with the team and getting to express
                    ideas and work together to create something unique.</p>

                <h2>Building a Snake Enclosure</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>This 360 VR video is a simulation and educational video that teaches the user to build a snake
                    enclosure.
                    The most beneficial asset I learned from this artifact was VR development.
                    The most enjoyable part of the project was working with Unity to create a VR experience.
                    It was something foreign to me, but despite the challenge, I really enjoyed learning the wonders
                    that VR
                    holds.</p>
